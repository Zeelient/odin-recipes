For this project,I will be creating a recipe that 
contains 4 gross recipes found on the web. With this project,
I hope to demonstrate both my HTML and CSS skills. At the end of all my assignments,
I will leave an updated paragraph of self-reflection of what I've learned throughout
these assignments and how I feel aftwards.

Yeah yeah, it took me the end of the year to create something incredibly subpar. I know and I'm not happy with my results. Next time won't take so long.
