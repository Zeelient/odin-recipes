    <p>Better known as aspic, this once popular dish has a few valuable uses to it.<br>
    The use of jello in aspic was used to preserve foods from the elements and rot.<br>
    It could also be used for keeping flavor and inhancing flavor, so it made sense<br>
    to use it for meat preservation. While aspic isn't as popular as it was in America,<br>
    it's still a big hit in Russia.</p>
